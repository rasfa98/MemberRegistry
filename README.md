# MemberRegistry

This is a simple member registry created for the second workshop in the course 1DV607.

## Prerequisites

First of all you need to install **\.NET Core Runtime** in order to run the application. This is due to the large file-size when creatin a self-contained application which could not be uploaded to CSQUIZ.

Make sure that you are in the application folder located in the root directory of the project.

`$ pwd`

Example output
