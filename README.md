# MemberRegistry

This is a simple member registry created for the second workshop in the course 1DV607.

## Prerequisites

First of all you need to install **\.NET Core Runtime** in order to run the application. This is due to the large file-size when creatin a self-contained application, that could not be uploaded to CSQUIZ.

A file called *data.json* has to exist in the root directory. This file will act as the storage for the application. The file should look like this:

```
[]
```

## Start the application

Make sure that you are in the root directory of the project.

`$ pwd`

Example output

`$ /Users/xxxx/Documents/MemberRegistry`

Start the application

`$ dotnet run`
