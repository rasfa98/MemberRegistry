# MemberRegistry

This is a simple member registry created for the second workshop in the course 1DV607.

## Prerequisites

You need to download one of the .exe zip-files that matches your operating system. [Here is a link to the available versions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12NIhRDNUtfFcx1tmsSPuYMdQtHc2Uace?usp=sharing)

## Start the application

To start the application simply double-click on the file called *MemberRegistry.exe*. The application will then open in your default terminal.

## Storage

The application uses a JSON-file (data.json) to store the members. This file should already be included in the application folder, but if it's not make sure to add it before starting the application. If you create a new file it should look like this:

```
